## Setup
To run this application, you will need [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html) and [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer.

#### MySQL Database Setup
If you do not have MySQL database already set up on your machine, visit the [MySQL installation page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html) to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL installed, you will be able to create the *Bamazon* database and the *products* table with the SQL code found in [bamazon.sql](bamazon.sql). Run this code inside your MySQL client (like [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) or [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)). To populate the database import the info.csv file into the products table, then you will be ready to proceed with running the Bamazon customer and manager interfaces.
